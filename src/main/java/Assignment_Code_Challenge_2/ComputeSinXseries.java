Write a program to compute sinx for given x.
The method should accept x and a positive integer n.
We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving x^n
This is what you need to compute:
sin x = x - x3/3! + x5/5! - x7/7! + x9/9! .......
